# MSCA-LaTex-template
A LaTex template to apply for the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship.

This LaTex template is intended to be used for creating an application for the 2025 Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships (HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01), see the call in the [Funding and Tenders Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01?order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=startDate&keywords=HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01&isExactMatch=true&status=31094501,31094502,31094503). 

This template is intended to help those applicants who wish to write their MSCA applications using LaTex. To the best of my knowledge, this template complies with all the requirements of the call (see the LICENSE file in this repository). It is optimized to use the maximum allowable margins and the minimum font size. The template covers the entirety of Part B of the application. However, for submission purposes, the final PDF will most likely need to be split into two separate files: Part B1 and Part B2.

Good luck with your applications!!
