# MSCA-LaTex-template
A LaTex template to apply for the MSCA Postdoctoral Fellowship

This template is intended to be used for creating an application for the 2025 Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowships (HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01), see the call in the [Funding and Tenders Portal](https://ec.europa.eu/info/funding-tenders/opportunities/portal/screen/opportunities/topic-details/HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01?order=DESC&pageNumber=1&pageSize=50&sortBy=startDate&keywords=HORIZON-MSCA-2025-PF-01-01&isExactMatch=true&status=31094501,31094502,31094503).

To the best of my knowledge it meets all the standards of the call and it is optimized to have the largest margins and the smallest font size (check the LICENSE file in this repository). The file contains a template for part B of the application. Most probably, the final PDF should be splitted into 2 files containing part B-1 and part B-2 for making the submission.

Good luck with your applications!!
